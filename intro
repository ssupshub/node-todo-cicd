**Project Overview: CI/CD for Node.js To-Do List Application**

This project involves implementing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js-based To-Do List application. The application facilitates the management of daily tasks, allowing users to create, update, and track their tasks efficiently.

**Architecture and Technologies:**

1. **Kubernetes**: Used for orchestrating containerized applications, ensuring scalability, high availability, and seamless deployment of the To-Do List application.

2. **Docker**: Employed to containerize the Node.js application, providing a consistent and portable environment for development, testing, and production stages.

3. **NPM**: Utilized for managing project dependencies and scripts, ensuring smooth build and deployment processes.

4. **AWS EC2**: Hosts the application and its infrastructure, providing a reliable and scalable cloud environment for running the containerized application and CI/CD pipeline.

**Key Features:**

- **Task Management**: Users can add, update, and manage their daily tasks effectively.
- **Automated Deployment**: The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes ensures that the application can handle increasing loads and scale as needed.
- **Consistency**: Docker containers provide a uniform environment across development, testing, and production stages.
- **Efficient Dependency Management**: NPM facilitates the management of project dependencies and scripts, ensuring smooth operations.
